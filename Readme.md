# Witter

## Inspiration

Social media hacks have become very common and they can range from being a minor nuisance to straight up criminal.
The recent major hack on twitter accounts have shown us the ugly side of this problem but we feel the worst is yet to come.
That's why we were inspired to come up with a safer and smarter social media app that is without any hassles and TypingDNA's API helped us achieve this.

## What it does

On the surface Witter is just another social media app but it's very secure in its core. It uses TypingDNAâ€™s API to authenticate the user each time the user wants to broadcast their thoughts (called "Moo" in our lingo) and hence it prevents hackers from using another user's account.
